                <p className="about__content">We are a group of people who love animals and are willing to
                 devote themselves to protecting animals. We are committed to presenting the most news and 
                 information about animals to our users. Find the latest news and information about animals 
                 on our website. We also regularly organize online or offline activities to help adults and
                  children learn more about animals and nature, and help more people get close contact with 
                  and learn about animals. Our website also supports membership registration, and registered
                   members can make appointments for activities organized by us. In the future, we will also 
                   update part of the animal encyclopedia and build a database about animals to facilitate
                    users to look up information.</p>
